      "description": "Hi my name is Chuck Altopiedi Iâ€™m from and live in Pittsburgh, PA.  I have  two undergraduate degrees, a Criminology degree and a Film Degree and am now in school for software development. I became interested in software development while learning to program My raspberry pi as a hobby. Before becoming a student at Code Fellows I started several Udemy programming classes including, python, unity and C#, and javascript. At Code Fellow my focus thus far has been on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  My interests include: Video games, Movies, TV, Woodworking, building projects with raspberry pis, and general tinkering.  After Code Fellows my ultimate goal is to get a job working on video games, robotics, or a combination of the two.",
